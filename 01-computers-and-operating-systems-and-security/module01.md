### Machine learning
Machine learning (ML) is a critical domain within artificial intelligence that emphasizes the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to perform specific tasks without explicit instructions. Instead, these systems learn and make predictions or decisions based on data. Here's a more technical breakdown:

Types of learning:
  
-  Supervised learning: Algorithms learn from labeled training data, aiming to predict outcomes for new inputs.
-  Unsupervised learning: Algorithms identify patterns in data without needing labeled responses, often used for clustering and association.
-  Reinforcement learning: Models learn to make sequences of decisions by receiving feedback on the actions' effectiveness.
