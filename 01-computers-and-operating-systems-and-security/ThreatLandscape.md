- Users often unknowingly let the threat in
- Best defense: Be careful with suspicious emails and check links carefully before clicking



### Ransomware Attacks (Second Most Common):

- Locks owners out of their systems until they pay a ransom
- Has affected major organizations and even entire countries
- Protection includes:
  - Using strong passwords
  - Keeping systems updated
  - Controlling system access



### Botnet Attacks (13% of attacks):

- Uses automated programs to overwhelm systems
- Can use multiple infected devices to attack a target
- Defense involves monitoring network traffic for suspicious activity




### Malware Types:


- Virus: Self-replicating code that infects files

- Trojans: Malicious software disguised as legitimate programs
- Ransomware: Encrypts data and demands payment
- Spyware: Secretly monitors user activity
- Adware: Unwanted advertising software
- Rootkits: Hides malicious software from detection


### Network Attacks:
